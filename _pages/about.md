Hi there! I am Xia Zeng, currently a PhD candidate on Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London. Supervised by [Dr. Arkaitz Zubiaga](http://www.zubiaga.org/), I'm a member of the Social Data Science lab and the Cognitive Science Research Group. I hold a Master's degree on Linguistics with Distinction from University College London. Previously I was a visiting student at UC San Diego and a research assistant at TU Darmstadt. I am interested in applying natural language processing (NLP) methods and linguistic theories on claim validation.
