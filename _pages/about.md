Hi there! I am Ashley, a.k.a Xia(霞) Zeng(曾). Feel free to call me either Ashley or Xia. I don't have strong preferences here.:)

I'm currently a Computer Science PhD candidate at Queen Mary University of London, supervised by [Dr. Arkaitz Zubiaga](http://www.zubiaga.org/). I'm a member of Computational Linguistics lab and the Social Data Science lab under the Cognitive Science Research Group. I received a Master's degree in Linguistics with Distinction from University College London. Previously I was a visiting student at UC San Diego and a research assistant at TU Darmstadt. 

My PhD research is on few-shot claim verification for automated fact-checking. During my PhD, I also joined HSBC AI CoE as a post-doctoral research assistant via the Turing Internship Network to work on Gen AI evaluation for internal use cases.

I am generally interested in NLP and LLM research and applications, e.g., fact-checking, machine translation and AI chatbot.
