Hi there! I am Xia(霞) Zeng(曾). My old friends call me Ashley and my colleagues call me Xia. I don't have strong preferences, anything nice works for me. :)

I'm currently a Computer Science PhD candidate at Queen Mary University of London, supervised by [Dr. Arkaitz Zubiaga](http://www.zubiaga.org/). I'm a member of Computational Linguistics lab and the Social Data Science lab under the Cognitive Science Research Group. I received a Master's degree on Linguistics with Distinction from University College London. Previously I was a visiting student at UC San Diego and a research assistant at TU Darmstadt. 

I am interested in applying natural language processing (NLP) methods and linguistic theories on claim validation, particularly few-shot veracity classification. Apart from fact-checking, I am also interested in various other NLP fields in general, e.g., machine translation and dialogue system. Ultimately I am a big fan of formal semantics and would be really happy to see/help further progress on neural-symbolic methods in NLP. However, my current focus has been active learning and reinforcement learning.
